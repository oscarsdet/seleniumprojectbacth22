- cssSelector :
	- it is one of the 8 locators of Selenium
	- using cssSelector, we can create custom locators
	- we are not limited to only id, name and class attributes.
	- we can use ANY attribute and their values.

syntax: tagName[attribute='value']
ex:

<div id="tt55" name="oo00" for='something4'>
	<a href="https://google.com"> GOOGLE </a>
</div>
Locating div element using all of the attributes.

--> div[id='tt55'] --> div[name='oo00'] --> div[for='something4']

--> All of the above attributes are locating the SAME web element.

HOW TO MOVE FROM PARENT TO CHILD USING CSSSELECTOR?

We use ">" sign to move from parent to child.
syntax: tagName[attribute='value'] > childTagName

ex: Locating "Forgot password" header from http://practice.cybertekschool.com/forgot_password

div[id='content'] > div > h2
div[class='example'] > h2
Why do we need to move from parent to child?

Sometimes the web element we are trying to locate does not have a unique attribute/value.
In this scenario, we can locate one of the parents that has a unique attribute value, and move down to child web element we are trying to locate.
We CANNOT go from CHILD TO PARENT using cssSelector.

XPATH:
	- 1 of 8 locators of Selenium.
	- Using xpath we can create custom locators.
	- We can use any attribute and value provided using xpath.
	- We can move from parent to child OR child to parent using xpath locator.
How many types of xpath locators we have?

2 types of xpath locators
#1- ABSOLUTE XPATH:

Absolute xpath starts with "/"
We have to start from the root element, meaning "html" tag
And we go down 1 by 1 to the desired web element
It is not stable. If there is any minimal change happen in the html structure, our locator would break.
It is not recommended to use.
ex: Locating "Forgot password" header from http://practice.cybertekschool.com/forgot_password

Using absolute xpath.

/html/body/div/div[2]/div/div/h2


#2- RELATIVE XPATH:
	- Relative xpath starts with "//"
	- "//" means we can start anywhere in the html page.
	- We can use any attribute and value to be more specific on which web element we want to get.
	- Relative xpath is more reliable because we are being very specific with what we want.
	- We have multiple syntaxes for relative xpath

syntax:
#1- //tagName[@attribute='value']

//toyota[@color='red']
//toyota[@vin='asdfkl;jas;dfkjasdr98723498']
//toyota[@plate='L44N23']
#2- //tag[.='text'] --> this syntax locates using text

	ex: 	//label[.='E-mail']
#3- //tag[contains(@attribute, 'value')] --> this syntax locates using part of the given attribute value. --> it does not look for exact match --> even partial match will work

ex:
	//form[contains(@name, 'password')]


-->	<input type="text" name="email" pattern="[a-z0-9._%+-]+@[a-z0-9.-]+\.[a-z]{2,3}$" required="">

--> 	//input[contains(@pattern, 'a-z')]
--> How do we go from parent to child using XPATH?

Using "/" we can go from parent to child.

  //tagName[@attribute='value'] / childTagName
ex: Locating "Forgot password" header from http://practice.cybertekschool.com/forgot_password with xpath:

//div[@id='content']/div/h2 --> will return "Forgot Password" header

//div[@class='example']/h2

driver.findElement(By.xpath("//div[@class='example']/h2"));
--> HOW TO GO FROM CHILD TO PARENT IN XPATH?

Using "/.." we will go from child to parent
syntax: //tagName[@attribute='value'] /..

IMPORTANT NOTE: --> "//" in xpath means start from anywhere. --> We can jump even after locating web element --> see example below;

	//div[@id='content']//h2
xpath can do more than css, but it is little complex to write. - Css is slightly faster then xpath on IE, other browsers it is negligible.

Css is easier to write and read,cleaner syntax
1.css cannot locate element using text xpath://*[.="Don't Click"] css: NA

2.css cannot find from matches based on index(different parents) xpath:(xPathFormula)[indexNumber] css: NA 3.css cannot locate child to parent xpath: //button/../ --> move to parent css: N
